### CortiVox â€“ the cortex of your documents [Work in progress]

The name **CortiVox** comes from *cortex* (the brainâ€™s cortex) and *vox* (voice). It refers to the part of the brain that processes information, makes connections, and gives meaning â€” exactly what the app does with your documents.  

**What does this mean for your app?**  
- **Smart metadata:** CortiVox reads document content, understands context, and automatically fills in metadata such as sensitivity, category, or type.  
- **Reliable classification:** Detects sensitive data like passport numbers or citizen IDs and marks them as *Confidential*.  
- **Future-oriented:** Not limited to metadata alone â€” CortiVox can evolve into a broader AI brain for Nextcloud, generating summaries, labeling documents, or uncovering relationships between files.  
- **The voice of insight:** Like the cortex, CortiVox translates raw information into actionable knowledge, turning every document into a clear story.  

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **CortiVox is the thinking layer in Nextcloud that gives your documents a voice and meaning.**
