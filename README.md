### CortiVox – the cortex of your documents [Work in progress]

The name CortiVox comes from cortex (the brain’s cortex) and vox (voice). It refers to the part of the brain that processes information, makes connections, and gives meaning — exactly what the app does with your documents.

What does this mean for your app?
	•	Smart metadata: CortiVox reads document content, understands context, and automatically fills in metadata such as sensitivity, category, or type.
	•	Reliable classification: Detects sensitive data like passport numbers or citizen service numbers (BSN) and marks them as Confidential.
	•	Future-oriented: Not limited to metadata alone — CortiVox can evolve into a broader AI brain for Nextcloud, generating summaries, labeling documents, or uncovering relationships between files.
	•	The voice of insight: Like the cortex, CortiVox translates raw information into actionable knowledge, turning every document into a clear story.

👉 In short: CortiVox is the thinking layer in Nextcloud that gives your documents a voice and meaning.
